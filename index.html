                <p class="c-align">Volcanoes are natural wonders that have fascinated and sometimes terrified us throughout history. 
                    Since the early days, volcanic eruptions have been happening frequently everywhere around the world. 
                    These natural events can vary greatly in size and impact, from small, relatively harmless outbursts to colossal explosions 
                    that reshape landscapes and impact global climate.
                </p>
                <p class="c-align"> 
                    Understanding the patterns and behaviors of volcanic eruptions is crucial for the safety of communities 
                    living near active volcanoes. It also helps scientists, researchers and the community anticipate and mitigate the 
                    potential hazards associated with these events.
                </p>
                <p class="c-align">In this visualisation, we will dive into the world of volcanoes and look at 
                    the different eruptions which happened around the world thoughout the years. We will also learn about their distribution and 
                    characteristics of this natural phenomenon.</p>

              <p class="c-align">
                According to the map visualisation above, we can see that volcanic eruptions happen most frequently
                at <span class="map-text"> coastal areas </span>. These are usually continental rift zones where tectonic plates are pulling apart, 
                leading to the formation of rift valleys. Magma rises to fill the gaps, causing volcanic 
                eruptions.
                </p>
                <p class="c-align">
                That being said, volcanic eruptions can also occur in other geological settings, 
                like between continents, underwater, etc.

                        From the bar chart above, we can conclude that South America has the highest 
                        number of volcanic eruptions up until now, with a total of <span class="count-text"> 197 </span> eruptions. 
                        West Indies have the least number recorded, which is 17 volcanic eruptions.

                <p class="c-align">
                    The scatterplot above shows the elevation of each volcanic eruption 
                    throughout the years. The earliest recorded volcanic eruption dates 
                    back to <span class="bold-text"> 10450 BCE </span>. Back then, not 
                    many eruptions are recorded. However, due to the advanced technologies 
                    and large databases, many more volcanic eruptions are recorded in the 
                    <span class="bold-text"> year 1600 onwards </span>.

                    The elevation of each volcano is recorded in this scatterplot as well.

                    This means that most volcanic eruptions recorded are from volcanoes situated 
                    <span class="bold-text"> above sea level </span>. This does not mean that 
                    there are more volcanoes on land compared to underwater, but since 
                    underwater volcanoes are not easily observable, they are often overlooked 
                    and not recorded into databases. On the other hand, volcanic eruptions above 
                    sea level are often easily observed.

                    The <span class="bold-text"> Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) </span>

                    A VEI of 0 corresponds to non-explosive 
                    eruptions, often characterized by the effusion of lava, while 
                    a VEI of 8 represents the most cataclysmic and devastating 
                    volcanic eruptions, with the potential to have global 
                    climatic effects.

                    Volcanic eruptions can cause a range of devastating damages, including 
                    <span class="bold-text"> loss of life, injuries, destruction of homes, and people going missing. </span> 
                    Hot lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and volcanic gases can lead to fatalities. 
                    Additionally, eruptions can cause injuries to those who are exposed to 
                    ashfall, projectiles, or scalding gases. Volcanic eruptions also result in the 
                    destruction of houses and infrastructure, including roads and utilities, due 
                    to the sheer force of the eruptive events and the accumulation of volcanic 
                    materials like ash and pumice. People may go missing due to the chaos and 
                    disarray caused by eruptions, making it challenging for authorities to 
                    account for everyone's safety.

                    This shows that volcanic eruptions are usually very deathly and dangerous.
